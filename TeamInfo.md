## Project Summary
The project is an application that serves as a compendium for students in UIUC so that they can contribute information on courses and professors. The purpose of this project is to increase visibility of course feedback and reviews and provide a platform where students can contribute, view and visualize aggregated feedback on courses that have been taught by UIUC in order to assist them in planning for degree completion and picking their core courses or general education courses that they might want to select.

The project will be a web application where students can perform queries on both course and professor reviews that have been already entered. They will also be able to add, delete and update their own reviews for professors and courses. Since this application contains data scoped to the course and the professor, users will also be able to enter data scoped to both the course and professor.
